# GW2-mechanic-timer
A mechanics timer overlay for GW2.

A pretty simple mechanics timer overlay for GW2. Allows you to add/edit new or existing encounters as needed, in case you feel so inclined. You can add in extra icons you might want to use into the ./Images folder wherever you have the .exe and those should be picked up too the next time you start the program.

Any changes you make to existing encounters/new encounters you add will be saved when you close the problem and choose to save changes.
