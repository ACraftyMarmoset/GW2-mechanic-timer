# GW2-mechanic-timer
A mechanics timer overlay for GW2.

A pretty simple mechanics timer overlay for GW2. Allows you to add/edit new or existing encounters as needed, in case you feel so inclined. You can add in extra icons you might want to use into the ./Images folder wherever you have the .exe and those will be picked up too.

Quick word of warning, any changes you make *at all* will be immediately saved so watch out for that! I will be adding a "confirm" button or similar at some point.
